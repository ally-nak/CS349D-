      "Answer:  Cinderella reached her happy ending by attending a royal wedding where the prince fell in love with her. Despite her step-family's mistreatment and attempts to keep her from attending the event, Cinderella received beautiful dresses and slippers from a magical bird that allowed her to go to the wedding in style. At the event, the prince only had eyes for Cinderella and tried to learn more about her. After a magical encounter, Cinderella managed to escape the prince but left behind a golden slipper. The prince then searched for the mysterious girl who fit the slipper, eventually finding Cinderella and realizing she was the one he had been searching for. They were reunited, and Cinderella's happy ending came when she married the prince and lived happily ever after.\n"
